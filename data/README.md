# Data Overview

This project uses different datasets across its three branches due to the nature of the input required by each approach.

---

### 1. Numerical Feature-Based Approach
- **Dataset Source**: Figshare - "Voice Samples for Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Healthy Controls"
- **Contents**: 41 samples from Parkinson‚Äôs patients, 40 from healthy controls
- **Data Type**: Isolated, prolonged vowel sounds (.wav)
- **Use**: Acoustic and prosodic feature extraction (e.g., Jitter, Shimmer, HNR)

---

### 2. Spectrogram-Based Approach
- **Derived From**: Same Figshare dataset used above
- **Use**: Mel spectrograms and log-Mel spectrograms generated from audio
- **Input to**: CNN-based image models (EfficientNet, ResNet, etc.)

---

### 3. Speech-to-Text + BERT Approach
- **Dataset Sources**:
  - **Healthy Samples**: Mozilla Common Voice (English, clean recordings)
  - **Parkinson‚Äôs Samples**: SJTU Parkinson‚Äôs Speech Dataset (downloaded from GitHub)
- **Data Type**: Full speech sentences
- **Reason**: Needed coherent speech input suitable for Whisper ASR and BERT-based NLP
